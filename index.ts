/**
 * When an interface type extends a class type it inherits the members of 
 * the class but not their implementations. 
 * It is as if the interface had declared all of the members of the class 
 * without providing an implementation. Interfaces inherit even the private 
 * and protected members of a base class. This means that when you create an 
 * interface that extends a class with private or protected members, that 
 * interface type can only be implemented by that class or a subclass of it.
 * 
 * This is useful when you have a large inheritance hierarchy, but want to 
 * specify that your code works with only subclasses that have certain 
 * properties. The subclasses donâ€™t have to be related besides inheriting 
 * from the base class. For example:
 */

class Control {
  private state: any;
}

interface SelectableControl extends Control {
  select(): void;
}

class Button extends Control {
  select() { }
}

class TextBox extends Control {
  select() { }
}

class Image {
  select() { }
}

class Location {
  select() { }
}

/**
 * In the above example, SelectableControl contains all of the members of Control, 
 * including the private state property. Since state is a private member it is 
 * only possible for descendants of Control to implement SelectableControl. 
 * This is because only descendants of Control will have a state private member 
 * that originates in the same declaration, which is a requirement for private 
 * members to be compatible. Within the Control class it is possible to access the 
 * state private member through an instance of SelectableControl. Effectively, a 
 * SelectableControl acts like a Control that is known to have a select method. 
 * The Button and TextBox classes are subtypes of SelectableControl 
 * (because they both inherit from Control and have a select method), but the 
 * Image and Location classes are not.
